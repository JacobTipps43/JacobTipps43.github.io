            <h3>Why this website?</h3>
            <p>There are hundreds of websites with some made by credible sources, and some not. I am making this website because I want one source that you can trust that is made by a person who has put hundreds upon hundreds of hours into this game. I have also played almost every type of build and beat the game with almost every different kind of build, so I know what works and is good advise, and what advise should be ignored.</p>
