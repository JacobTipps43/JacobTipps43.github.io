        <h1>Strength VS Dexterity in Elden Ring</h1><br>
        <p>
            In the video game Elden Ring players can have a varity of builds spanning all types of weapons and spells. 
            But there are two main build that most players use, and those are Strength and Dexterity.
            With Strength build players will use giant wepaons and are slower.
            Meanwhile Dexterity builds use smaller weapons and are faster.

        <h2>Common Strength Build</h2>

        <p>
            Their are similarites in the builds, with the main one being that they both use close range weapons.
            But this is where the differences start to show, with Strength builds using giant weapons that deal massive damage that are slow, and Dexterity builds using smaller weapons that deal less damage but are faster.
            Another one would be that Strength builds are more tanky and can take more hits, while Dexterity builds are more squishy and have to dodge more.
            The last one would be that Strength builds are more for PvE, while Dexterity builds are more for PvP.
